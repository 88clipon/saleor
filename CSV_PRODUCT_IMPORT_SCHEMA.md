# Product CSV Import Schema

This document describes the CSV file format required for importing products into the Saleor e-commerce platform.

## CSV File Structure

The CSV file should use commas (`,`) as delimiters and UTF-8 encoding. The first row must contain the column headers.

## Required Fields

These fields **must** be present in every row:

| Field Name | Description | Example | Notes |
|------------|-------------|---------|-------|
| `slug` | Unique product identifier used as SKU | `ray-ban-rb5121-47x22` | Must be unique across all products. Will be used as both product slug and variant SKU. Lowercase, alphanumeric with hyphens. |

```

## HTML Descriptions

The `description` field supports both **plain text** and **HTML formatting**. The system automatically detects HTML content and converts it to Saleor's EditorJS format.

### Supported HTML Tags

- **Headers**: `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`, `<h4>`, `<h5>`, `<h6>`
- **Lists**: `<ul>` (unordered), `<ol>` (ordered)
- **List Items**: `<li>`
- **Paragraphs**: `<p>`, `<div>`
- **Text Formatting**: `<strong>`, `<em>`, `<b>`, `<i>` (styling preserved as text)
- **Links**: `<a href="...">` (converted to plain text with URL)

### HTML Description Example

```csv
slug,name,price,description
example-product,Example Product,29.99,"<ol><li><strong>Feature 1:</strong> Description of feature 1</li><li><strong>Feature 2:</strong> Description of feature 2</li></ol>"
```

### CSV Escaping for HTML

When including HTML in CSV files:
1. **Wrap the entire description in quotes** if it contains commas
2. **Escape quotes** inside HTML by doubling them (`""`) if using quotes in HTML attributes
3. Keep HTML on a single line or use proper CSV multi-line format

**Example with quotes in HTML:**
```csv
slug,name,price,description
product-1,Product Name,29.99,"<p>Description with ""quoted"" text</p>"
```

### Plain Text Alternative

If you don't want to use HTML, you can use plain text and it will be automatically formatted:
```csv
slug,name,price,description
product-2,Simple Product,19.99,This is a simple plain text description.
```

## Important Notes

1. **Slug as SKU**: The `slug` field serves as both the product slug and the variant SKU. This ensures unique product identification.

2. **Uniqueness**: Each `slug` must be unique. If a product with the same slug already exists, it will be skipped during import.

3. **Channel Support**: Products will be automatically added to all active channels in the system. Prices will be converted based on channel currency (USD as base, PLN = USD * 4).

4. **Product Type**: If `product_type_slug` is not specified or doesn't exist, the default "Sunglasses" product type will be used with these settings:
   - `has_variants`: false (single variant per product)
   - `is_shipping_required`: true
   - `is_digital`: false

5. **Category**: If `category_slug` is not specified or doesn't exist, the default "Clip-On Sunglasses" category will be used.

6. **Warehouse**: Products will be added to the default warehouse. Stock quantity will be set according to the `stock_quantity` field.

7. **Pricing**: Base prices should be in USD. The system will automatically convert prices for other channels (e.g., PLN).

8. **Boolean Values**: Use `true`, `false`, `1`, `0`, `yes`, `no` (case-insensitive) for boolean fields.

9. **Empty Values**: Optional fields can be left empty. Use empty strings or omit the value between commas.

## Import Process

When a CSV file is imported:

1. **Validation**: Each row is validated for required fields and data types
2. **Duplicate Check**: Products with existing slugs are skipped
3. **Product Creation**: Product record is created with basic information
4. **Variant Creation**: A single variant is created with the slug as SKU
5. **Channel Listing**: Product is added to all active channels with appropriate pricing
6. **Stock Assignment**: Initial stock is set in the default warehouse
7. **Attributes**: Brand attribute is assigned if provided

## Error Handling

- Invalid rows will be skipped and logged
- The import process will continue even if some rows fail
- A summary report will be provided showing:
  - Number of products successfully imported
  - Number of products skipped (duplicates)
  - Number of errors with details

## Recommendations

1. **Test First**: Always test with a small batch (5-10 products) using the dry-run option
2. **Backup**: Backup your database before large imports
3. **Validate Data**: Ensure all slugs are unique and follow the naming convention
4. **Price Format**: Use decimal format with dot separator (e.g., `29.99`, not `29,99`)
5. **Encoding**: Save CSV files in UTF-8 encoding to support international characters
6. **Line Endings**: Use standard line endings (LF or CRLF)

## Multi-Channel Pricing

If you have multiple channels with different currencies, the base price (in USD) will be converted:
- USD channel: Uses the specified price
- PLN channel: Price Ã— 4
- Other channels: Uses the specified price (you may want to customize conversion rates)

## Future Extensions

The schema may be extended in the future to support:
- Multiple variants per product
- Product collections
- Product images (via URLs or file paths)
- Custom attributes
- SEO metadata
- Tax classes
